            <ul>
                <li>
<span="xoxo"><p>Verse:</p></span>
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feeling I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
               </li>                
               <li>
<span="xoxo"><p>Pre-Chorus:</p></span>
You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, especially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, (oh)
               </li>
               <li>
<span="xoxo"><p>Chorus:</p></span>
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind
'Cause baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
               </li>
               <li>
<span="xoxo"><p>Verse:</p></span>
I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're going through
But baby-girl, I'm not blaming you
Just don't blame me too, yeah
'Cause I can't take this pain forever
And you won't find no one that's better
'Cause I'm right for you, babe
I think I'm right for you, babe
               </li>
               <li>
<span="xoxo"><p>Pre-Chorus:</p>
You know what I'm thinking, see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away
               </li>
               <li>
<span="xoxo"><p>Chorus:</p></span>
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind
'Cause baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
               </li>
               <li>
<span="xoxo"><p>Bridge:</p></span>
<span class="highlight">I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby</span>
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
               </li>
               <li>
<span="xoxo"><p>Chorus:</p></span>
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind
'Cause baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
